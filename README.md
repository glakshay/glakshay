<h1> üëã Hi there </h1>

I am <strong>Lakshay Gopalka</strong>, currently pursuing Masters in <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics engineering</a> student at WPI and incoming Robotics and AI intern at Siemens.
  
üî≠ <strong>I‚Äôm currently working on</strong></strong></strong></strong>: 
- Computer Vision and OpenCV
- Researching on soft robotics using novel techniques in Fluidics & Magenetism in the <a href="https://nemitzroboticsgroup.com">Nemitz Robotics Group</a>

üë®‚Äçüíª <strong>My recent work involves</strong></strong></strong>: 
- Using novel deep learning methods with robotics using C++/ Python for industrial manipulator for various grasping operations in task space. 
- Implementaion of iterative Learning controller for <a href="http://softrobotics.wpi.edu/research.php">Soft snake robot</a>  
- Developing algorithms for robot control, dynamics, point cloud, system modeling and identification, and robot simulation in environments like ROS or MATLAB. 
- Other works involved using Deep learning to generate audio, haiku using GAN topologies.

During my summer, I was a Software intern at Massachusetts Biomedical Initiatives where my role involved Software development, writing code, developing laser patterns, CO2 laser testing on various specimens like bones, enamel for medical applications. I was prior working as a Researcher for TKU University in Taiwan while I was pursuing undergrad in Mechatronics engineering. My work involved developing autonomous control for fixed-wing UAV and using Computer Vision to identify pitch/yaw angles for commercial vehicles. My other internships at firms like ABB, JCB, Robot Components have helped me to apply and develop my skills in multi-disciplinary fields.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <strong>Area of Interest</strong></strong>:

- Automation, robotics systems, SLAM, perception, machine, and deep learning, computer vision, non-linear control, mechatronics system and hardware-software integration.

Through academic coursework and personal projects, I have a solid understanding of mobile robotics, trajectory control systems, dynamical systems, path planning, collision avoidance, kinematics, localization, electrical engineering, artificial intelligence, deep learning, soft robotics, computer vision, and algorithm optimization.

üìö <strong>Skills</strong>:

- Languages: C++, Python, MATLAB, Verilog, HTML, Tensorflow

- Tools: SolidWorks, Ansys, Mission Planner, LabVIEW, FluidSIM, ROS, Gazebo, Rviz, MoveIt Pixhawk, MultiSim, Linux, PLC, Motion Capture system, Arduino, Git
